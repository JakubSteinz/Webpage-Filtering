So! This is a showcase of filtering on a page with javascript. I don't have much to say, except it did take a bit of blood, sweat and tears for someone like me since i am not that good at scripting and programing. So it was a tiny bit of pain. Here are some of the pictures here, And i have made a few things, like when you enter an invalid municipality, you'll get this! (DISCLAIMER: All's in Czech!)

I have made a board with ten municipalities ranging from Prague to even the village i live in (Kunratice u Cvikova).

I have even made a navigational selection, so if you click on any of these, they will get you there immedeatelly

And for the grand finale, how does it look as whole?

Tadaa! I had to make the whole thing smaller thanks to Google's zooming feature so i could get in the whole look of the page.
